In the grand narrative of human evolution, our species has been remarkably adept at overcoming the challenges posed by our environment. From the era of hunting mammoths to the complexities of modern society, we've specialized in tasks that ensured survival and dominance. Yet, this specialization came with a cost.

Our brain is now physically hard-wired for our ancestral environmnent, where the monkey brain still dominates our decision-making processes. The monkey brain is essentally in charge of navigation and dealing with the physics of the world. It's the part of the brain that's responsible for our survival instincts, our fight or flight response, and our ability to navigate the physical world.

On the other hand our new brain (neocortex) is responsible for our higher cognitive functions, such as reasoning, language, and problem-solving. It's the part of the brain that allows us to think abstractly, to plan for the future, and to imagine things that don't exist in the physical world.

Think of the neocortex as a litte boy sitting on the back of an elephant:

> Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them. - Alfred North Whitehead

As this philosopher Alfred North Whitehead pointed out, the evolution of civilization has been marked by our ability to offload cognitive tasks to the monkey brain so that we can focus on more important things.

Technology is a new way to do so, for example when using Google Maps to navigate a city, we're offloading the task of navigation to Google's algorithms, freeing up our neocortex to focus on other things.

AI has recently reached an _activation energy_ that allow humans to program the world, that is to create life, in a very intuitive language: English, this is called "**Software 3.0**". This is a game changer, as it allows us to offload even more tasks to technology, and to focus on the things that really matter.

It is different than **Software 2.0** and **Software 1.0** which required more efforts for humans to create artificial life.
